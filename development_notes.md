First few lines of code written and added to github. Nothing much.

# 5/4/2018 - 01

* Added a cool makefile that accounts for *depends*.
* Added to Presentation class to keep the screen and keyboard at arm's length and nicely encapsulated.
* Added to Game class making ```main()``` trivial.
* (q)uit command

# 5/4/2018 - 02

* Decided to use C++ 2020 for ```enum class```.
* Improved logging code - cannot avoid C macros.
* Continued abstracting ```curses``` into the Presentation class. 

# 5/4/2018 - 03

* Dropped ```enum class```. Oh well. TTY modes are bit masks now.
* Neat TTY hack that allows me to seamlessly shift between blocking and nonblocking I/O.
* (^v)ersion command.
