First few lines of code written and added to github. Nothing much.

# 5/4/2018 - 01

* Added a cool makefile that accounts for *depends*.
* Added to Presentation class to keep the screen and keyboard at arm's length and 
nicely encapsulated.
* Added to Game class making ```main()``` trivial.
* Fixed the shell shortcut for starting Code on Hyde.

# 5/4/2018 - 02

* Decided to use C++ 2020 for ```enum class```.
* Improved logging code - cannot avoid C macros.
* Continued abstracting ```curses``` into the Presentation class.
