# pnh - Perry's NetHack

## May 2018

This is yet another nethack-like game. About once a year I get a notion to write my own nethack-like game to address what I see as deficiencies in existing versions and derivatives. Among these deficiencies, I include:

* All organisms have to poop. Players, especially should poop. And, if they do have to "go", what are the implications? 
Frankly, the older one gets (I am in my fifties) the ever more important pooping gets. This weighs heavily on my mind. Squirrel.

* Caves are not laid out in grids of rectangles. This must go.

* H. R. Giger's Alien has not been given its due in games of this sort. Why stop at seeing a grave of a previous instance of you? Why not pass yourself glued to a wall with a hole in your chest?

* Critters should be more intelligent. Way more intelligent.

* Magic models are too simple. In NetHack, the ability to cast a spell is binary - either you can or you can't.
I think a more nuanced model might be nice. Far fewer spells but those that remain could be made to play multiple
roles depending on *how* they're used.

## November 2022

So I started writing another nethack-like game the other day and realized
I had started one some time back that I was reasonably pleased with. Took
me a while to find it and lo and behold, I had not touched the source in
four years and six months.

I guess this is going to be a retirement project for me as I am not in my
fifties any more :(.
