# pnh - Perry's nethack

This is yet another nethack-like game. About once a year I get a notion to write my own nethack-like game to address what I see has deficiencies
in the existing versions and derivatives. Among these deficiencies, I include:

* All organisms poop. Players, especially should poop. And, if they do, what are the implications? What are the implications of not pooping?
Frankly, the older one gets (I am in my fifties) the ever more important pooping gets. This weighs heavily on my mind. Squirrel.
* Caves are not laid out in grids of rectangles. This must go.
* H. R. Giger's Alien has not been given its due in games of this sort. Why stop at seeing a grave of a previous instance of you? Why not
pass yourself glued to a wall with a hole in your chest?

The above, and more, keep me up at night. There is something wrong with a world without a nethack-like game that does not have the above features.
Some people cure cancer, some work for world peace. This is *my* cross to bear.
